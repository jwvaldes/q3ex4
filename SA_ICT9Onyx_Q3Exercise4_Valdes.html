		<p style="font-family: 'Shantell Sans', cursive;">Hong Kong is a city in the country of China. It is known for being one of the most densely populated places in the world!</p>

		<center>
			<p style="font-family: 'Shantell Sans', cursive;">My family and I stayed at the Panda Hotel!</p>
			<img src="ph1.jpg" width="80%" height="80%" class="rounded">
			<p style="font-family: 'Shantell Sans', cursive;">It's a very good hotel from my experience! It had outdoor pools and the rooms were clean and pretty! I guess what's most memorable from my experience there is that me and my siblings each got a free tiny stuffed panda once it was time to leave. They were adorable!</p>
			<br>
			<p style="font-family: 'Shantell Sans', cursive;">We didn't spend a lot of our days staying at the hotel, though! Because we visited the Hong Kong Disneyland!</p>
			<img src="dl1.jpg" width="80%" height="80%" class="rounded"><br>
			<p  style="font-family: 'Shantell Sans', cursive;">I may not remember much, since my visit was long ago in the year of 2017. I do remember having the most fun there! We ate lots of sweets and went to so much rides! Although I also remember being disappointed at the waffles... *shivers*</p><br>
			<p style="font-family: 'Shantell Sans', cursive;">We also visited lots of malls, although mostly only ate at familiar fast-food chains since we were familiar with the menu and it was more likely for the people who work there to know how to speak English.</p><br>
			<h3 style="font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;">That's it for my Hong Kong travel blog entry! Let's meet again at the next destination! <3</h3>
